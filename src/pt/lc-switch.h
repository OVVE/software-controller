/**
 * \file
 * Implementation of local continuations based on switch() statment
 * \author Adam Dunkels <adam@sics.se>
 *
 * This implementation of local continuations uses the C switch()
 * statement to resume execution of a function somewhere inside the
 * function's body. The implementation is based on the fact that
 * switch() statements are able to jump directly into the bodies of
 * control structures such as if() or while() statmenets.
 *
 * This implementation borrows heavily from Simon Tatham's coroutines
 * implementation in C:
 * http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html
